# Machine Learning Training

These modules have been included to recreate how the Machine Learning Models are trained. We recommend using the Jupyter `.ipynb` files, to be able to go step by step. 
To run them, we use either the [VSCode integrated environemnt](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Jupyter Labs]([https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/)), [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)...

Additionally the python codes have been added.
